# GeForce NOW game checker for STEAM store as a chrome extension

This is a small extension built to easily find out if a game that you are browsing on steam is compatible with GeForce Now.
If it is, a small check-mark will be added to the title, where as otherwise a cross will be shown.

If Google decides to remove this from their Web-Store you can still use this.
Just download the repository as `.zip` file, head over to chrome://extensions/ and enable the developers mode.
Once enabled you will be able to upload your own packages, this is where you should upload the previously downloaded `.zip` file.

Once installed you can browse the steam library (https://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/) and see which games support GeForce Now.
